Hi! You need me.

You will want to have a directory structure here like:
```
img/
├── cache
├── thinking
├── deal
├── glitter
│   └── <your return gif will go here>.gif
└── ...etc
```
Some day you won't need to add these img dirs yourself for each of the individual effects but alas that will happen in the future, maybe, you're not the boss of me.
